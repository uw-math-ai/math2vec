Docstring for benchmarking.src.evaluation

This script contains functions and classes for evaluating the performance of various embedding models.

It takes in the embeddings generated for various queries
and compares them again ground truth data to compute metrics.
Then, it takes the metric scores and generates evaluation reports,
visualizations, and summaries.
TODO: Reconsider how to structure getting rankings and ground truth data.

@Parameters: None
